  China is due to launch the world's first quantum communications satellite into
  space this July, as reported by Digital Trends. The 500-kilogram (1,100
  pounds) box of complex bolts is part of the novel Quantum Experiments at Space
  Scale (QUESS) mission, which will ride through the atmosphere on the Long
  March 2D rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert.
