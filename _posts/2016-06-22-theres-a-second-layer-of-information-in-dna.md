  The way A, T, G, and C are arranged in the DNA double helix determines how
  proteins are produced in the body of multi-celled organisms like us. And now,
  physicists have confirmed that there's a second layer of information in DNA.
  In addition to the genetic information, we're also determined by the
  mechanical properties of DNA.
